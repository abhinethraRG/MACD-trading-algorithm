# MACD Trading Algorithm

A Python project that uses the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator to create a simple trading strategy. The goal was to take real stock data, generate buy/sell signals, test how the strategy would have worked in the past, and visualize the results.

## Project Overview
This project implements a trading strategy using the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator to identify buy and sell signals in stock price data.  
The workflow covers:  
**Data Retrieval & Preprocessing:** Loading and preparing historical stock price data for analysis.  
**Indicator Calculation:** Computing short-term and long-term exponential moving averages, MACD line, and signal line.  
**Signal Generation:** Defining buy and sell points based on MACD crossovers.  
**Strategy Backtesting:** Simulating trades over historical data to evaluate profitability and risk.  
**Visualization:** Plotting stock price trends, MACD indicators, and buy/sell points for clearer interpretation of the strategyâ€™s performance.  
  
This project demonstrates how technical indicators can be translated into actionable trading signals and tested in a systematic way.

## Skills Demonstrated  
**Time Series Analysis:** Processed and analyzed historical stock market data with a focus on temporal patterns.  
**Algorithmic Trading:** Designed a trading system based on the MACD indicator, incorporating rule-based buy/sell logic.  
**Backtesting:** Evaluated strategy performance using historical data to estimate returns and identify potential risks.  
**Data Visualization:** Created clear visual plots to track MACD trends, crossovers, and trading decisions alongside price movement.  

## Personal Takeaway

This project gave me practical experience in turning financial data into a working trading strategy. I learned how to design, test, and explain a simple system, and it helped me see the importance of checking strategies on past data before applying them in real markets. It also gave me more confidence in using Python for finance-related problems.
